            <p>
              The people of Villa de Monte Fresco, a slum outside the city of
              Masaya, Nicaragua are among the 62% of the Nicaraguan population
              that lack access to proper sanitation facilities. The lack of
              these systems results in fecal contamination of water sources and
              the spread of diseases. In Nicaragua, diarrheal diseases born
              from this type of contamination are the leading cause of deaths
              for children under five years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decreasing the prevalence of diarrhea requires containing human
              waste by the use of latrines.  Without complete latrine coverage,
              the community drinking water is vulnerable to contamination.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Monte Fresco, a community of 880 people, 20% of the households
              do not have latrines and over 60% of the households that have
              latrines have ones that are defective in infrastructure and
              functionality. These latrines were improperly designed and
              constructed using makeshift parts and shelters. During the rainy
              season their pits overflow, spreading dangerous contaminants onto
              the street and into community water sources. Furthermore, the
              high prevalence of malnutrition amongst children in Monte Fresco
              raises their susceptibility to diarrheal infections.
            </p>

            <p>
              This initiative supports the implementation of community driven
              sustainable sanitation through the use of double pit composting
              latrines. These latrines are a long lasting and ecologically
              sound alternative to the current pit latrines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each family will be responsible for constructing their own
              latrines. A 16 member community commission has already been
              established to take charge of the activity and resource
              management during the construction phase. Healthcare
              professionals from the local clinic have trained a group of
              community health workers to ensure latrine maintenance and
              promote hygienic practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project will lower the incidence of diarrheal diseases,
              provide the basic human dignity of using proper toilets, and
              strengthen the capacity for further community planning and
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Donations to support this project will be used to cover the
              expenses of the materials needed to build the latrines. This
              project will serve the 170 families (880 people) of Monte Fresco.
