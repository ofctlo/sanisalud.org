              associate at UC San Francisco and managing sanitation projects in

            <p>

              with the health of the Nicaraguan people.  Though he fights the
              spread of diseases, he can't help but infect others with his
              contagious smile and warm enthusiasm.

            <h3>Megan Maurino</h3>
            <p>
              Megan Maurino is a student in the College of Natural Resources
              studying Conservation and Resource Studies with a concentration
              in Hydrological Engineering. She is currently working for the
              Physical Plant and Campus Services at UC Berkeley as a Water
              Conservation Intern. A wide variety of projects that she has been
              a part of include a campus wide energy conservation effort which
              documented how much energy/water heating systems are losing due
              to heat inefficiency. Additionally she is project leader of a
              pilot project that involves converting two buildings on the UCB
              campus to low-flow toilets. She has experience working with
              plumbing staff, stationary engineers, and the UCB Energy Office.
              Megan also shows an understanding and interest in sustainability
              by being the Sustainability Director of Amnesty International at
              Cal, part of a human rights organization for Cal students.  When
              she is not working on designing water systems or advocating for
              the rights of her fellow community members, you will can catch
              Megan's radiant smile as she pirouettes to rhythms of
              contemporary jazz.

            <h3>Jason Cristobal</h3>
            <p>
              Jason is SaniSalud's graphic designer and webmaster, and has been
              part of SaniSalud since the very beginning.  Having been born in
              a country with frequent natural disasters (Philippines), he
              understands the importance of sanitation.  Despite not being born
              in the U.S., he knows more about America than most Americans
              because he has a degree in American Studies.  Outside of graphic
              design and cultural studies, his interests include filmmaking and
              the French language, which he will put to good use this year
              during his first trip to Europe.
